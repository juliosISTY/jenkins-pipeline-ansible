# jenkins-pipeline-ansible

**Requirement**

To use docker images like jenkins agent in your pipeline file, you need to install *Docker Pipeline* plugin and restart your Jenkins VM when installation is complete.

**Notes**

Don't forget to create environments variables credentials (vaultkey and sudopass) in Jenkins.
*Vault Key = devops*
